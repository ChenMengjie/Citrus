  "body": "### Welcome to Citrus Pages.\r\n\r\nCitrus is a toolkit for single cell sequencing analysis under development. \r\nCitrus is written in c++ with easy-to-use R wrappers. \r\nTo use Citrus, the installation of **Rcpp** and **RcppArmadillo** is required. \r\n\r\n### Available methods\r\n\r\nNow a normalized method and a clustering method are available in the distributed version. \r\n\r\n* Method 1: **scPLS**: a normalization method to remove unwanted variation using both control and target genes.\r\n\r\n  The description of methodology and algorithm can be found in the manuscript:\r\n\r\n  Chen M, Zhou X: **Normalization of single cell RNA sequencing data using both control and target genes**. 2016\r\n\r\n  which can be downloaded at: http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/21/045070.\r\n\r\n  A **vignette** on how to use scPLS is distributed together with the package.\r\n\r\n* Method 2: a clustering method which can account for confounding factors.\r\n\r\n  The description of method and a tutorial of software on clustering will be available shortly.\r\n\r\n### Why do we call it citrus? \r\nCitrus is not a short name for any of our methods. To honor Bowtie/Cufflinks and Salmon/Sailfish series, we are creating a fruit collection. \r\n\r\n### Author\r\n**Mengjie Chen** (UNC) \r\n\r\n**Xiang Zhou** (Umich)\r\n\r\nBug report, comments or questions please send to mengjie@email.unc.edu.",
