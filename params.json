  "body": "### Welcome to Citrus Pages.\r\n\r\nCitrus is a toolkit for single cell sequencing analysis under development. \r\nCitrus is written in c++ with easy-to-use R wrappers. \r\nTo use Citrus, the installation of Rcpp and RcppArmadillo is required. \r\n\r\n### Available methods\r\n\r\nNow a normalized method and a clustering method are available in the distributed version. \r\n\r\nMethod 1: scPLS: a normalization method to remove unwanted variation using both control and target genes.\r\n\r\nThe description of the methodology and algorithm can be found in the manuscript\r\nChen M, Zhou X: Normalization of single cell RNA sequencing data using both control and target genes. 2016\r\nwhich can be downloaded at: http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/21/045070\r\n\r\nA vignette on how to use scPLS is distributed together with the package.\r\n\r\nMethod 2: a clustering method which can account for confounding factors.\r\n\r\nThe description of the method and the tutorial of software on clustering will be available shortly.\r\n\r\n### Why do we call it citrus? \r\nCitrus is not a short name for any of our methods. To honor Bowtie/Cufflinks and Salmon/Sailfish series, we are creating a fruit collection. \r\n\r\n### Author\r\nMengjie Chen (UNC) \r\n\r\nXiang Zhou (Umich)\r\n\r\nBug report, comments or questions please send to mengjie@email.unc.edu.\r\n",
